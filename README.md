# asteroids

The objective of "asteroids" is to destroy asteroids and saucers. The player controls a triangular ship that can rotate left and right, fire shots or laser straight forward, and move forward. Once the ship begins moving in a direction, it will continue in that direction for a time without player intervention unless the player applies thrust in a different direction. The ship eventually comes to a stop when not thrusting. The player can also send the ship into hyperspace by going beyond screen limits causing it to disappear and reappear in a an opposite location on the screen, at the risk of self-destructing or appearing on top of an asteroid.
